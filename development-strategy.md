# Development Strategy

## WireFrame

> link to your wireframe.cc wireframe. (you can ignore the evaluation buttons in your wireframe)

## Steps Plan

> add one row to this table for each user story you define

| _Step Name_ | User Story | Changes in HTML | Changes in CSS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| __Live Boilerplate__ | As an enthusiastic HYF student I can navigate to an empty website so that I know the project is set up correctly | An empty template project with `doctype`, language, charset, `head` & `body`, and evaluation script | an empty main `style.css` and an existing evaluation style |
|  | |  |  |
| __Main structure__ | As an enthusiastic HYF student I started to copy the design of Duck Duck Go page with the main structure of div elements into [master](https://github.com/
ekaterinaasf/duck-duck-clone/). | Index.html made with the rough draft of div structure (with main blocks and main hierarchy) | Styles for body tag |

| | As an enthusiastic HYF student I made a first step in designing elements and added logo with the social networks link and main menu button. All this can be found [header](https://github.com/ekaterinaasf/duck-duck-clone/tree/header/). | Added two div containers for header wrapper and logo. | Added appropriate styles for these containers and their children  |
